# Sales Data Analysis
# You are given a nested list representing sales data for three quarters. Each quarter contains a list of tuples with monthly sales figures:

# Tasks:
# Calculate Total Sales per Quarter

# Use unpacking to compute and display the total sales for each quarter.

# Find the Month with Highest Sales

# Identify the month with the highest individual sales across all quarters.

# Create a Flat List of Monthly Sales

# Generate a flat list of all monthly sales in the format: ("Jan", 1000), ("Feb", 1200), ....

# Use Unpacking in Loops

# Use tuple unpacking while iterating to clearly separate months, sales values, and quarters.
